# Lab 01 - Lab Access

## Prerequisites

* Laptop with SSH client (PuTTy). The Windows client can be downloaded [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

## Lab Assignment & Credentials

On the whiteboard/projector, there will be a link to an etherpad listing all the available lab environments along with the default password. Follow the link and write your name alongside a lab number (i.e. bgp03 - John Doe).

Take note of the name of the "lab master" server on the whiteboard/projector. This will be the jump server from where you will access

If you ever need a new lab environment, return to this page and simply assign yourself a new one. Mark any old/broken lab environments as "broken/recycle" and it will be rebuilt.

## Deployment Layout

This lab consists of a "Lab Master" which is shared by all the students using the "bgpXX" login (replacing XX with lab assignment number, i.e. bgp05). Within that account directory is a deployed Terraform consisting of two physical servers (web servers). These hosts are dedicated to the students lab.

```

## Lab Master Access

With your assigned lab username (i.e. bgp03), log into the lab master server using the your assigned lab and the password. You'll need to use a SSH client (i.e. PuTTy).

```
ssh <your_lab_username>@<lab_master_server>
```

## Verify Deployed Web Instances

We've already taken the liberty of deploying a number of servers into your environment and setting them up with IPv6 and Anycast. This way you can see the end result. Don't worry, you'll get a chance to deploy it all yourself shortly.

Let's verify that all your hosts are deployed OK. You should have two physical hosts deployed, each with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

```
cd WorkspaceTemplate
terraform output
```

```
Anycast IPv6 Address = 2604:1380:2:2303::1
Anycast IPv6 Network = 2604:1380:2:2303::/64
IPv6 Anycast Curl Command = curl http://[2604:1380:2:2303::1]
SSH Access Server 0 = ssh root@147.75.98.155 -i mykey
Server IPs v4 = [
    147.75.98.155,
    147.75.76.169
]
Server IPs v6 = [
    2604:1380:2:2300::7,
    2604:1380:2:2300::d
]
```

And let's do a quick network connectivity check to each host.

```
ping -c 5 <Server #1 IP v4>
ping -c 5 <Server #2 IP v4>
```

You should see something like:

```
bgp03@stl:~/WorkspaceTemplate$ ping -c 5 147.75.194.9

All the hosts should reply back from the ping requests. If, for some reason, your hosts are not responding, please go back and pick a different lab assignment and reverify.

## Next Steps

Once you've validated your environment, proceed to [Lab 2](Lab02.md)
