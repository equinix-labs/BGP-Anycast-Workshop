# Lab 09 - Lab Cleanup

## Prerequisites

* Access to the lab master server from Lab 01

## Lab Teardown

Congrats! You made it through the lab exercises!

Please take a moment to tear down (turn off) all the deployed hosts so they can be made available to others.

```
terraform destroy
```

Please mark your master lab account on the etherpad as complete so it can be deallocated.
